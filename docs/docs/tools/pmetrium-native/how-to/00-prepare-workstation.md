***Workstation*** - in this context is considered to be Localhost rather than CI. For CI please follow this guide **[this guide](./03-run-ci.md)**, as it has some more specific details you need to take care of.

### Android prerequisites

The Workstation should have:

- **[Android Debug Bridge (adb)](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)**
- Docker (only in case you want see metrics on your localhost)
- .NET 6+ - **ONLY in case you would like to build or publish PMetrium Native from the source code!**

Platform can be any: Windows, MacOS, Linux...

:::tip
It's expected that you have *adb* available in your CLI from any location. To check that adb commands work as expected you may simply execute the next command:
``` bash
> adb version
```
:::

:::caution
The list above it's a minimum set of prerequisites for PMetrium Native, but you may need some more settings for the Workstation in case you would like to run autotests:
- NodeJS
- AppiumServer
:::

### IOS prerequisites

The Workstation should have:
- MacOS platform. PMetrium Native is based on XCode for IOS, which works only on MacOS
- **[XCode](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=Xcode)** installed. It gives CLI tool such as `xctrace`
- installed `libimobiledevice`, more details on **[GitHub](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice)**. You may install it with brew package manager: 
  ```shell
  > brew install libimobiledevice
  ```
- installed PMetriumNative template for XCode Instruments. You need to download and install it then:
  ```shell
  > curl -LJO https://github.com/parimatch-tech/PMetriumNative/tree/main/IOSInstruments/PMetriumNativeInstruments.instrdst
  ```
  ![image](./00-prepare-workstation/inst_template.jpg)
- Docker (only in case you want see metrics on your localhost)

### Run Infrastructure

1. Clone the **[PMetrium Native repository](https://github.com/parimatch-tech/PMetriumNative.git)**
2. Open folder: 
    ```shell
    > cd ./PMetriumNative/Localhost/
    ```
3. Run docker-compose file for data storage and visualization. No need to change something in the file, everything is ready 

    ```shell
    > docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build
    ```

      ``` yaml title=docker-compose.yml
       version: "3.9"
       services:
         influxdb-pmetrium-native:
             build: ./influxdb
             container_name: influxdb-pmetrium-native
             hostname: influxdb-pmetrium-native
             ports:
              - "8086:8086"
             volumes:
              - influxdb-pmetrium-native:/var/lib/influxdb
             environment:
               - INFLUXDB_DATABASE_NAME=PMetriumNative # InfluxDB user login: admin, password: admin
             restart: always
      
         chronograf-pmetrium-native:
             build: ./chronograf
             container_name: chronograf-pmetrium-native
             hostname: chronograf-pmetrium-native
             depends_on:
              - influxdb-pmetrium-native
             ports:
              - "8888:8888"
             volumes:
              - chronograf-pmetrium-native:/var/lib/chronograf
             restart: always
           
         grafana-pmetrium-native:
             build: ./grafana
             container_name: grafana-pmetrium-native
             hostname: grafana-pmetrium-native
             depends_on:
               - chronograf-pmetrium-native
             ports:
              - "3000:3000"
             volumes:
              - grafana-pmetrium-native:/var/lib/grafana
             environment:
               - INFLUXDB_DATABASE_NAME=PMetriumNative # Grafana user login: admin, password: admin
             restart: always
      
       volumes:
           influxdb-pmetrium-native: 
           chronograf-pmetrium-native:
           grafana-pmetrium-native: 
      ```
4. Once docker compose is started and run you may check if everything is ok, go to any browser and open grafana: `http://localhost:3000`, there should be a ready-made dashboards for Android and IOS and after test, you will see next:

    :::caution attention
    Grafana credentials:
    - Login: **admin**
    - Password: **admin**

### Run PMetrium Native

PMetrium Native works as a Web host in order to have an ability to communicate over HTTP requests with the outer world. See **[PMetrium Native API](../architecture/03-development/04-pmetrium-api.md)**. There are at least three common ways how to start PMetrium Native, see details below.

#### I. Single File Application - download and run (Localhost|CI)
This is the easyest way to work with PMetrium Native as standalone service (server) on your localhost or CI.
Main cons of this approach:
- you do not need .Net installed on your machine/CI runner
- you do not need to build or publish .Net application 

You only need to download the ready .tar.gz with executable files inside for your target OS - **[DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/parimatch-tech/PMetriumNative/tree/main/PackageRegistry)** 

Exemple with the `curl`:
```bash
> curl -LJO https://github.com/parimatch-tech/PMetriumNative/raw/main/PackageRegistry/PMetriumNative.osx-arm64.v2.0.tar.gz
```

Where:
- `win-x86` - one of the target OS architectures. Available: 
    - `win-x86`, `win-x64`, `win-arm`, `win-arm64`, `osx-x64`, `osx-arm64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm`
- `v2.0` - version of the ready build package, see **[the full list](https://github.com/parimatch-tech/PMetriumNative/tree/main/PackageRegistry)**. The older versions please look at other branches.

Extract archive, open folder and run PMetrium Native server as a separate process. You may add some additional settings to it throught **[PMetrium Native config](../architecture/03-development/03-pmetrium-config.md)**. For example:
	
```shell
> tar -xzf PMetriumNative.osx-arm64.v2.0.tar.gz --directory ./PMetriumNative.osx-arm64.v2.0
> cd ./PMetriumNative.osx-arm64.v2.0
> ./PMetrium.Native.Host &
```
& - moves the process to the background on Linux-based runners

#### II. Single File Application - publish and run (Localhost|CI)
A single file application can be very useful for CI, when you may build PMetrium Native on your localhost for a target Workstation OS and then just run it without build action there. See below for how to do that

- Clone the **[PMetrium Native repository](https://github.com/parimatch-tech/PMetriumNative.git)** to the Workstation
- Open the folder <br/> 
	`./PMetriumNative/PMetrium.Native/PMetrium.Native.Host` 
- Run the following command: <br/>
  ```
  dotnet publish -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained true -c Release -r TARGET_OS
  ```
  where: <br/> 
  TARGET_OS - the target OS of the Workstation, so far can be:
	- `win-x86`
	- `win-x64`
	- `win-arm`
	- `win-arm64`
	- `osx-x64`
	- `osx-arm64` - M1,M2 for MacBooks
	- `linux-x64`
	- `linux-arm`
 - then your PMetrium Native as a single executable file will be saved in <br/> `./PMetriumNative/PMetrium.Native/PMetrium.Native.Host/bin/Release/net6.0/TARGET_OS/publish`
 - now you can run PMetrium Native as a Web host

#### III. Run from IDE (Localhost)

- Clone the **[PMetrium Native repository](https://github.com/parimatch-tech/PMetriumNative.git)** to the Workstation and open it in your preferable IDE that supports .Net 6+
- Start the new process for ***PMetrium.Native.Host*** project

:::tip
- You need to run PMetrium Native only once before all your tests. It may be even hosted on your Workstation infinitely (as Appium server does for example)
- You may want to change some settings for PMetrium Native with the help of **[appsettings.json](../architecture/03-development/03-pmetrium-config.md)**
:::

:::danger PAY ATTENTION
PMetrium Native works as a web host and creates some additional processes under the hood, it requires granting some security permissions on the Workstation. For example, on a Windows machine, you will be asked through the pop-up window to grant some permissions right after the command to run the host. On Linux machines, the approach may differ in terms of permissions
:::

### HealthCheck

After all the setup you can check if the PMetrium Native web host works as expected, just run the command:
```bash
> curl http://localhost:7777/HealthCheck/Android
```
Or (depends on what platform you are going to test)
```bash
> curl http://localhost:7777/HealthCheck/IOS
```

The response should be just `OK` if everything is fine
